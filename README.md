# conversational-bot
I'm working on a conversational bot that will be able to give you an answer to anything you say to it or ask it. I'll need bruteforcing and much more. I'm new to JS, but I'm a master python coder, so if anyone knows how to port JS to Py please let me know.

# info
I am making this project as a personal challenge. I have been learning Javascript for over 5 months now, so I decided to make this big project. If anyone wants to have a conversation about this (no pun intended) without anyone else seeing it, contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com. Other contact options in the contacts section.

# issue form
To submit issues:
1. Explain the problem in detail
2. Explain how to recreate it (Include all optional steps too)
3. Explain what should happen
4. Explain what actually happens
5. Tell me what you think I can do to fix it
6. Locate where you think the problem is
7. Any extra notes
8. Technical details (e.g what program or website you are using to run the code, OS, etc.)

# how to run
This is less of a program and more of just raw code. You must input the code (in the conversation-bot.txt file) into an HTML editor. I will put a .html file in as well. I'm considering making .exe and .app files, but that's for later I guess. 

# contact
Contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com. If you want to use my code in your website, instead contact my "business" email bottomtext97@gmail.com (Don't mind the names of these emails, I made them when I was like 8 so yeah.)
